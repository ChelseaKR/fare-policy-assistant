# Corpus changelog

Each entry is a corpus version (the deterministic id from
`assistant.corpus.corpus_version`) and what changed since the previous snapshot.
A deployment can approve a version here and pin to it with
`FPA_PINNED_CORPUS_VERSION`; the `/version` endpoint reports whether the running
deploy matches.

Schema-2 source snapshots are tracked separately under `corpus/snapshots/` by
their full `snapshot_version`. They retain exact raw bytes and receipts and
distinguish semantic `content_version` from later source reverification. The
12-character entries below remain the compatibility history for deployed pins;
they are not retroactively relabeled as source-complete evidence.

This history starts with the current snapshot. There is only one snapshot so far,
so there is nothing to diff against yet. The weekly corpus-freshness automation
(`.github/workflows/corpus-freshness.yml`) is the intended writer of future
entries: on a re-fetch that changes any document, it can call
`assistant.corpus.diff_corpus` against the prior snapshot and append the added,
removed, and changed documents below.

## 0938fff0539a (2026-06-17)

Initial recorded version. Five agencies, 11 documents, 90 chunks: Monterey-Salinas
Transit (MST), Santa Barbara MTD (SBMTD), Yolobus, Sacramento Regional Transit
(SacRT), and Humboldt Transit Authority (HTA). Fetch dates per document are in
`corpus/manifest.yaml` and the per-snapshot `corpus/raw/<id>.meta.yaml` files.

## f459805469ef (2026-08-13 UTC)

Added Fresno Area Express (FAX), operated by the City of Fresno: 6 agencies, 14
documents, 101 chunks. Three documents, all fetched 2026-08-13 UTC:
`fax-fares` (the Fares & Passes page), `fax-reduced-fare-program`, and
`fax-reduced-fare-program-es` — the last two the corpus's first PDFs, and the
second a genuine Spanish translation rather than an untranslated shell.

FAX is the first Central Valley agency here and the first whose reduced fare is
a suspension rather than a discount: qualifying riders pay $0.00 on fixed route
"while subsidy funding is available", with no published end date. The base fare
is $1.00 and paratransit stays at $1.25 for the same rider, so this corpus
version is also the first where "what is the fare" has no single right answer.

This id was recomputed after merging the Yolobus 2026-2027 refresh, so it
covers both changes. Any further corpus change landing before this does needs
another `make ingest` and another re-stamp of this heading.
