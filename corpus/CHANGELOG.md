# Corpus changelog

Each entry is a corpus version (the deterministic id from
`assistant.corpus.corpus_version`) and what changed since the previous snapshot.
A deployment can approve a version here and pin to it with
`FPA_PINNED_CORPUS_VERSION`; the `/version` endpoint reports whether the running
deploy matches.

Schema-2 source snapshots are tracked separately under `corpus/snapshots/` by
their full `snapshot_version`. They retain exact raw bytes and receipts and
distinguish semantic `content_version` from later source reverification. The
12-character entries below remain the compatibility history for deployed pins;
they are not retroactively relabeled as source-complete evidence.

This history starts with the current snapshot. There is only one snapshot so far,
so there is nothing to diff against yet. The weekly corpus-freshness automation
(`.github/workflows/corpus-freshness.yml`) is the intended writer of future
entries: on a re-fetch that changes any document, it can call
`assistant.corpus.diff_corpus` against the prior snapshot and append the added,
removed, and changed documents below.

## 0938fff0539a (2026-06-17)

Initial recorded version. Five agencies, 11 documents, 90 chunks: Monterey-Salinas
Transit (MST), Santa Barbara MTD (SBMTD), Yolobus, Sacramento Regional Transit
(SacRT), and Humboldt Transit Authority (HTA). Fetch dates per document are in
`corpus/manifest.yaml` and the per-snapshot `corpus/raw/<id>.meta.yaml` files.
